One of the few certified COVID-NEGATIVE shops open on the high street is a small grocery store called ESFO.

I was talking to the owner who explained it stands for European Subsidised Farmers Organisation.
She gave me a business card and suggested I not Google them.

When I asked why, she explained there was a bank called ESFO - the East Shanghai Financial Operations.

Naturally, I did some googling and then some poking around the finance company's website until I stumbled across a page that looked like JSON. An unobfuscated API endpoint of customer data.

I thought it couldn't possibly be!

I picked an account at random and logged in. First time. I could see this random person's transactions.
Then I shat myself realising I had done some actually super-illegal hacking. I wrote down everything I had found out and emailed it to the Guardian.
