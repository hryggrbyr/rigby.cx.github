The snow came today.

Thick and fast and, before I could get my boots on, it was over.

I sat in the window and saw the world I knew so well  unrecognisable beneath a white sheet.

I grasp for similes and metaphors; the body of a lover or a corpse in a morgue.

But it's simply the place I love but different; nothing more and none the less special for that.
