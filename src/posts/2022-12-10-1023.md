Socialism doesn't have an issue with non-manual-labourers being included in the "worker" side of the equation - that's perfectly acceptable; you invent something, you design it, you market it - of course you're entitled to a share of the revenue from selling it. You're fairly compensated for your contribution. The issue is with the disproportionate skew towards shareholders, for example. Shareholders do considerably less than these other stakeholders, yet reap the lion's share of the income leaving the greatest contributors benefiting the least.
